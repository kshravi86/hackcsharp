	Explain the Spring MVC module
	
	MVC framework is provided by Spring for building web applications. Spring can easily be integrated with other MVC frameworks, but Springâ€™s MVC framework is a better choice, since it uses IoC to provide for a clean separation of controller logic from business objects. With Spring MVC you can declaratively bind request parameters to your business objects.
